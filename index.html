         <p class="para">Food is any substance that all animals and human beings consume in order to sustain life. Food is one of the basic necessities of life, along with water and shelter. Food contains various nutrients, minerals and roughage, each of which is required by our body. Eating a balanced diet is very important to sustain good health. If you consume little food or food that lacks essential nutrients, you will suffer from malnutrition. Food should be consumed in proper proportions. Over-eating is never considered good for your health...</p>
